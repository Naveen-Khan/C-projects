## 🧩 Project 2: Student Management System Using Stack (DSA)

### 📌 Description
The **Student Management System Using Stack** is developed as a **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** project.  
It demonstrates the **practical implementation of Stack (LIFO)** to manage student records, including an advanced **Undo functionality**.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Insert student records (Push)
- Display student records
- Search student by ID
- Delete recent record (Pop)
- Count total students
- Undo last insert/delete operation
- Save records to file (File Handling)

### 🧠 Data Structure Used
- Stack (LIFO – Last In First Out)
- Undo Stack for recovery operations

### ⏱ Complexity
- Insert / Delete / Undo: **O(1)**
- Search / Display: **O(n)**

### 📁 Folder

- Loops
- Basic authentication logic
